# Psychedelics_2023
Research on the boom in psychedelic drug research in the United States, based on patents and clinical trials registered from 1956 to 2023.

The goal was to measure de boom of the psychedelics in the pharmaceutical field. The information I found was displayed as text and image in a website. The information I used to explore the phenomenon was the record of Patents and patents fillings, as well as the Clinical Trials records. The goal then was to create dataframes with this information, so web scrapping was neccesary. Later on, I realized lot of this text was natural text, so I run a series of NLTK exploratory analysis using gensim-LDA.
